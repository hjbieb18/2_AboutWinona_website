      <h3>Lake Park</h3>

      <p>In my own personal opinion, Lake Park is a place I would recommend for any college student. During the winter it is not ideal, mostly because of frigid temperatures.</p>
      <p>During muggy summer days, Lake Park's beach is a popular site. Alongside the beach, Lake Park has a paved trail to rollerblade, take an evening stroll, or walk your dog.</p>
      <p>Aside from these basic activities, Lake Park gives public access to your own kyaks and provides the option to rent one for a few hours.</p>
      <p>The most popular attraction seen on the beach of Lake Park is frisbee.</p>

            <h3>Sugar Loaf</h3>        
            <p>Sugar Loaf is the most iconic site to see in Winona, according to locals and anyone who has come through the area.</p>
            <p>In order to get the true Winona experience, I highly suggest this scenic outlook. In comparison to the Great River Bluffs State Park, Sugar Loaf's trails are considered easy.</p>
            <p>People tend to notice this landscape simply because of the iconic rock formation. One can see this formation when driving into town from the La Crosse area.</p>
            <p>People are most likely to part take on this adventure during the fall, when the leaves are changing. This vantage point provides hikers to see Winona in contrast to the great Mississippi River. On a lucky day, people can be seen climbing the rocks of these bluffs.</p>

      <h3>Great River Bluffs State Park</h3>
      <p>This wonderful landscape provides guests the experience of hiking to the top of the bluffs.</p>
      <p>From personal experience, the Great River Bluffs gives a breathe takig perspective of the rural landscape of Winona.</p>
      <p>The trails moderate diffuclty gives guests of all shapes and sizes the oppurtunity to take in the wonders of Winona.</p>
      <p>Although, this site teds to follow Sugar Loaf. Great River Bluffs gives insights behind the true natural beauty of Winona.</p>
